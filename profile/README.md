# About the Lab

We partner with our clinicians, distilling specialized medical knowledge into software and mobile technology that doctors worldwide will be able to download and use.

We use quantitative imaging and machine learning to interpret large amounts of multidisciplinary data in ways that surpass the possibilities of the unaided human eye. Pediatric specialists use our medical devices to accelerate diagnosis and predict clinical outcomes in diseases of infancy and childhood. With an early diagnosis, physicians can deliver care faster and prevent health complications.
